					The Revenue Department of Thailand would like to encourage visitors to the Kingdom to claim their VAT refund on 
					goods purchased while in Thailand. If you are departing through international airports within 60 days of the purchase date, 
					and you are not a member of an airline crew, then you are eligible to claim your VAT Refund at any of over 4,000 shops and 
					outlets throughout Thailand. Look for a blue VAT Refund for Tourists sign. If you purchase at least 2,000 baht worth of 
					goods in any one store, you can ask for VAT refund form. When paying the bill, show your passport and fill out a PP10 VAT 
					Refund Application form. Also, don’t forget to save your receipts. You can combine multiple PP10 forms, but to claim a VAT 
					Refund they must total at least 5,000 baht under each name the application is filled out under. When you get to the airport, 
					just remember to go to the Customs counter BEFORE you check-in so they can inspect your goods and stamp your forms. After 
					you check in your luggage and pass through immigration, you can pick up your money at the VAT Refund counter inside the 
					terminal. For more information, log onto www.rd.go.th/vrt
